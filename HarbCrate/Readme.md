**HarbCrate**  is a mod that adds several defensive items and equipment to the game. It's mostly centered around shields.

### Items

* *Fragment* is a tier 1 (white) useless item, but maybe it does something when you get enough of them.
* The *Obsidian Bouche* is a tier 2 (green) defensive item that increases your maximum shield on multikill. It's comparable to infusion.
* The *Brawn over Brain* is a tier 3 (red) defensive item that aims to improve the interaction of shields, transcendence aside, with healing items. It does this by splitting up damage taken to deal a nonlethal amount to your health before dealing the rest to your shields (and then back to your health if you run out of shields). It also gives a 50% debuff duration reduction while you have shields.

### Equipment

* The *Coldsnap* freezes enemies around you for `3` seconds.
* The *Divination Distillate* heals both health and shields over time, and increases your luck while active. However, there's a catch: Once you are at full health and shields, the effect stops! If uninterrupted, the duration is `7` seconds.
* *The Writhing Jar* is a lunar equipment.
