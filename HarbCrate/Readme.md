# Harb Crate
---
**Harb Crate**  is a mod that adds several new items and equipment to the game. These items were designed to not break anything, but rather play with ideas I don't think have been put to use (enough) before. With the equipment extra care was taken to not make it overpowered in combination with gesture of the drowned.

Overview. More detailed numbers will follow as the release draws closer. Numbers that are **bolded** are likely subject to change.

### Items
* *Rubbish* is a tier 1 useless item, but if maybe it does something when you get enough of them.
* The *Obsidian Bouche* is a tier 2 (green) defensive item that gives you maximum shield on multikill. It's comparable to infusion.
* The *Brawn over Brain* is a tier 3 (red) defensive item that aims to improve the interaction of shields, transcendence aside, with healing items. It does this by splitting up damage taken to deal a nonlethal amount to your health before dealing the rest to your shields (and then back to your health if you run out of shields.). It also gives a 50% debuff duration reduction while you have shields.
### Equipment
* The *Coldsnap* freezes enemies around you for **3** seconds.
* The *Divination Distillate* heals both health and shields over time, and increases your luck while active. However, there's a catch: Once you are at full health and shields, the effect stops! If uninterrupted, the duration is **7** seconds.
* *The Writhing Jar* is a lunar equipment. It contains 2 worms.
