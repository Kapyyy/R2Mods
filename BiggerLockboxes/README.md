While still available, this mod is superceded by HarbTweaks.

Makes the rusted lockbox spawned from rusted keys increase in size as you acquire more keys.

There's default values set, but you can configure to scale it differently faster, or even to apply the scaling to the first lockbox.

If you just want to make the lockboxes bigger in general and don't want any fancy scaling, you can configure that too!

### Installation: 
Place in your Bepinex/Plugins folder.

### Multiplayer:
* Works for Host if host has installed.
* Might work for Client if client has installed (let me know!)

### RC1 Compatibility:
This mod IL hooks `RoR2.SceneDirector.PopulateScene`.
The release of this update should coincide with the release of a new Bepinex version, so this section should be moot.
