People without a Rusty Key can no longer open Rusty Lockboxes.

Mod made on request. I do not think this mod promotes an healthy enviroment, so it will not see a thunderstore release.

### Installation: 
Place the dll in your Bepinex/Plugins folder.

## Multiplayer:
Only Host needs it.

## Changelog:
- 1.0.0 Release!
