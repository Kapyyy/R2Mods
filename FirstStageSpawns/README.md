When you normally spawn in on the first stage, there are no enemies in the area and you have to wait for the enmies to spawn. This is often rather annoying, because you just want to get going.
This mod changes that. The first stage will now contain prespawned enemies. It accomplishes that by telling the game that it's actually on the second stage instead when checking if it should be prespawning enemies for the first stage.

### Installation:
