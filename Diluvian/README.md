**Is this balanced?**

## Multiplayer ##

Should work if everyone has the same difficulty mods installed.

## Changelog ##

* **1.0.1**: Regen for monster now activates only when they are out of danger. To compensate for this nerf, they've been buffed from 1% regen to 1.5% regen. *While the regen did make things harder, it did so at the cost of being really annoying to downright impossible if your damage was falling behind.*

## Compatibility ##

All hooks are only placed when the difficulty is ran, there are no effects outside the difficulty.
If you want me to add compatibility with a specific mod, ask me in the modding discord and I'll make an attempt.
