**Is this balanced?**
No.

**Have you ever obliterated on your own difficulty?**
Couldn't do it if I tried.

## Multiplayer ##

Should work if everyone has the same difficulty mods installed.

---

## Compatibility ##

All hooks are only placed when the difficulty is ran, there are no effects outside the difficulty.
If you want me to add compatibility with a specific mod, ask me in the modding discord and I'll make an attempt.
