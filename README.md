# Harb's mods for Risk of Rain 2

My mods are divided in three categories: Information, Quality of Life, and New Content.

## Information:
These mods aim to expose information to the player in a nonintrusive manner. They should not affect gameplay.
* [OSP Endscreen](https://github.com/harbingerofme/R2Mods/tree/master/OSP_Endscreen) is a mod that exposes the times the life of a player was saved by 'One-Shot-Protection'.

## Quality of Life
These mods are small changes that aim to fix a behaviour that is considered "annoying" by some players. These should have a minor impact on gameplay.
* [Bigger Lockboxes](https://github.com/harbingerofme/R2Mods/tree/master/BiggerLockboxes) makes lockboxes grow as you collect more keys. Highly configurable.
* [No More Triple Question](https://github.com/harbingerofme/R2Mods/tree/master/NoMoreTripleQuestion) makes Multishop terminals unable to hide all their content. It also makes a modest attempt to prevent those terminals from rolling the same item 3 times, meaning there should always be a choice.
### Not Recommended
These mods were made on request, and are not advisable for an "improved" experience.
- [Greedy Lockboxes](https://github.com/harbingerofme/R2Mods/tree/master/GreedyLockboxes) makes people without rusted keys unable to open lockboxes.
 

## New Content
These mods add new content, and as a result might significantly affect gameplay.
* [Harb Crate](https://github.com/harbingerofme/R2Mods/tree/master/HarbCrate) adds several new items and equipment to the game. *Release Pending.*
