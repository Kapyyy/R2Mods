# Deprecated
## Quality of Life
These mods are small changes that aim to fix a behaviour that is considered "annoying" by some players. These should have a minor impact on gameplay.
* [Bigger Lockboxes](https://github.com/harbingerofme/R2Mods/tree/master/BiggerLockboxes) makes lockboxes grow as you collect more keys. Highly configurable.
* [No More Triple Question](https://github.com/harbingerofme/R2Mods/tree/master/NoMoreTripleQuestion) makes Multishop terminals unable to hide all their content. It also makes a modest attempt to prevent those terminals from rolling the same item 3 times, meaning there should always be a choice.
* [First Stage Spawns](https://github.com/harbingerofme/R2Mods/tree/master/FirstStageSpawns) Enemies are already on the stage when you land there.
### Niche
These mods were made on request, but might not fit every player.
- [Greedy Lockboxes](https://github.com/harbingerofme/R2Mods/tree/master/GreedyLockboxes) makes people without rusted keys unable to open lockboxes.
- [No Forward Saw](https://github.com/harbingerofme/R2Mods/tree/master/NoForwardSaw) disables the automatic forward on MUL-T's saw. 
- [Shorter Medkits](https://github.com/harbingerofme/R2Mods/tree/master/ShorterMedkits) reduces the time it takes for the medkit to apply healing.
